**PASSWORD GENERATOR**
This program generates a random password for the user based on their input criteria.This is a Python script for generating random passwords of a specified length, with options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.The script begins with a welcome message and prompts the user to enter a password length, with a minimum of 8 characters. If the user enters a length less than 8, the script prints an error message and terminates.Next, the script prompts the user to choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the password. The user can select "y" or "n" for each option.After collecting the user's preferences, the script generates a string of possible characters based on the selected options. If the user did not select any character types, the script prints an error message and terminates.Finally, the script generates a random password of the specified length using the possible characters string and prints it to the user.This script can be useful for generating secure and complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack. Users can customize the password generation process to their specific needs, adding or omitting certain character types as desired.
